1.UniversityERP:-> This project is just started by me to make a webApp which can automate a lot of tasks of any University. Specially , I wanna make an University WebApp 2.0.
Now, I have just made an admin pannel and done CRUD operations with MySQL database. Managing Student data like Add new Student , Edit student data etc. Delete operation is not made yet for a reason. In future when I'll inject Spring Security then I will add this delete opration.
